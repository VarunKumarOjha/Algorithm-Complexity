# Algorithm-Complexity
Time Complexity of Algorithms

Emperical test of an algorithm in three different language C, Java, Python

Complexity order plot of the O(1), O(n), O(log n), O(n), O(n log n), O(n^2), O(2^n) algorithms (Fig. 1)

Runtime order of the O(1), O(n), O(log n), O(n), O(n log n), O(n^2), O(2^n) algorithms (Fig. 2)

*Fig. 2 Runtime order - Emperical (for a much larger n, the plot will change and nlogn and n^2 will show its Asymptotic behaviour)* -  Algorithm in O(n^2) is kind of have a break stament for certain condition and that lead to less emerical runtime.
